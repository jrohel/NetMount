# 1.2.0

## Features

- Server file names conversion to DOS 8.3 format

    The server implements its own conversion of existing file names to DOS short names 8.3.
    The advantage of the conversion is that it is independent of the operating system and file system.
    The disadvantage is that the mapping of converted file names to existing ones is only temporary
    in RAM and is unstable (re-created during some operations).

    Added optional argument `name_conversion=<method>` to the shared drive definition.
    Supported values for `<method>` are `RAM` and `OFF`. The default is `RAM`.
    The value `OFF` disables file name conversion.

## Fixes

- Update FilesystemDB::Item::last_used_time - Previously, `FilesystemDB::Item::last_used_time`
  was updated only in the `FilesystemDB::get_handle` method. This ignored client accesses made
  directly via the handle.

- FilesystemDB::Item::create_directory_list store only 65,535 items - This is due to the DOS FIND
  function using a 16-bit offset, which cannot address more entries.

## Other

- Added Makefile.cross: Example of Makefile for cross-compilation

- Optimize FilesystemDB::find_file: The loop now starts from the requested offset

# 1.1.0

## Features

- **Supports POSIX-compliant operating systems (Linux, *BSD, macOS, etc.) and Microsoft Windows**

    Previously only Linux was supported.

    - Linux `ioctl` is now used only in Linux build (for FAT attributes)
    - Implemented a new `UdpSocket` class, implemented for POSIX environments and Microsoft Windows
    - Implemented platform-independent byte order conversion functions (little-endian / big-endian)
    - Use `std::filesystem::space` instead of `statvfs`
    - Use `std::filesystem` for make/delete/change directory
    - Use `std::filesystem` for iterate directory and delete file
    - Use `std::filesystem::path::string` instead of `path::native`
    - Added Makefile.windows to build for Windows using MinGW

## Fixes

- Prevent appending an empty search template to the parent path

## Other

- Marked many variables as `const`

----

# 1.0.2

## Fixes

- open file: handle errors (exceptions) when testing directory existence

- Directory creation now respects umask

    Previously, directories were created with mode 0000, granting no permissions to anyone,
    which is typically not useful. Now, directories are created with mode 0777, and the effective
    permissions are controlled by the process's umask, just like file creation.

----

# 1.0.1

## Fixes

- Include "algorithm" header file

## Other

- More "path" and "handle" existence checks

----

# 1.0.0

- First version
